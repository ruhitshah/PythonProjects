# ðŸ’¬ Simple Keyword-Based Chatbot (Python)
This is a basic Python chatbot that uses a predefined dataset of intents, keywords, and responses to interact with users. It can respond to greetings, pricing inquiries, technical issues, services, and goodbyes â€” or prompt the user for clarification when it doesnâ€™t understand.
## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Predefined intents: greeting, pricing, technical issues, services, goodbyes, and unknown queries.
- Keyword matching to detect user intent.
- Randomized responses for a more natural conversation.
- Exit command to end the chat anytime.

| Intent          | Keywords                           | Example User Input            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Greeting        | hello, hi, greetings, hey          | "hello"                       |
| Pricing         | price, cost, pricing, charge       | "Whatâ€™s the price?"           |
| Technical Issue | issue, problem, bug, error         | "I found a bug"               |
| Services        | service, offer, solutions, product | "What services do you offer?" |
| Goodbye         | bye, goodbye, see you, exit        | "bye"                         |
| Unknown         | (anything else)                    | "Tell me a joke"              |
## How It Works
Intent Identification: Scans the user input for keywords and matches them to predefined intents in dataset.

Response Generation: Randomly picks a response from the intentâ€™s list of possible replies.

Unknown Handling: If no keywords match, returns a generic clarification request.
